Haitao Dan (MetaPack UK) - Performance Testing RESTful Microservices — A learning journey about performance testing will cover:

- Why is performance test more important for Microservices architecture? Motivations of performance testing (some considerations on this topic).

- The typical first journey. Talking about team Dodo’s performance testing and tuning for Newlook. Denial -> Illusion -> Reality -> Dream

- Automating performance testing. Using Gatling, Jenkins for load testing (measuring response time) and Load Detector for stress testing (capacity).

- An improved journey. Talking about the performance testing for H&M. Measuring SLA, trending, performance breakdown and testing Google geocoding.

- Conclusions and future works. Talking about lessons learnt and the ideal scenario.

As usually at the end there are communities announcements + raffle of Jetbrains licenses and Manning ebooks. Remember to enroll on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Zielona-Gora-JUG/events/230299419/" target="_blank">meetup</a> with a full name.
